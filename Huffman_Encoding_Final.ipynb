      "concerning Women are naturally much more stringent. But a general view of\n",
      "the Code may be obtained from the following summary: -- \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Every house shall have one entrance in the Eastern side, for the use\n",
      "of Females only; by which all females shall enter \"in a becoming and\n",
      "respectful manner\"[2] and not by the Men's or Western door.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. No Female shall walk in any public place without continually keeping\n",
      "up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Any Female, duly certified to be suffering from St. Vitus's Dance,\n",
      "fits, chronic cold accompanied by violent sneezing, or any disease\n",
      "necessitating involuntary motions, shall be instantly destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,\n",
      "under penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place\n",
      "without moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to\n",
      "indicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman, when\n",
      "travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by her\n",
      "husband; others confine Women altogether to their houses except during\n",
      "the religious festivals. But it has been found by the wisest of our\n",
      "Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on Females\n",
      "tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race, but also\n",
      "to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a State loses\n",
      "more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement\n",
      "at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their\n",
      "spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate\n",
      "climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes\n",
      "destroyed in one or two hours of simultaneous female outbreak. Hence the\n",
      "Three Laws, mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated States, and\n",
      "may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature, but in\n",
      "the interests of the Women themselves. For, although they can inflict\n",
      "instantaneous death by a retrograde movement, yet unless they can at once\n",
      "disengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of their\n",
      "victim, their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of Fashion is also on our side. I pointed out that in some less\n",
      "civilised States no female is suffered to stand in any public place\n",
      "without swaying her back from right to left. This practice has been\n",
      "universal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all\n",
      "well-governed States, as far back as the memory of Figures can reach. It\n",
      "is considered a disgrace to any State that legislation should have to\n",
      "enforce what ought to be, and is in every respectable female, a natural\n",
      "instinct. The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated undulation\n",
      "of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and imitated by the\n",
      "wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing beyond a mere\n",
      "monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the regular tick of\n",
      "the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the wife of the\n",
      "progressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose family no\n",
      "\"back-motion\" of any kind has become as yet a necessity of life. Hence,\n",
      "in every family of position and consideration, \"back motion\" is as\n",
      "prevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in these households\n",
      "enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute of\n",
      "affection. But unfortunately the passion of the moment predominates, in\n",
      "the Frail Sex, over every other consideration. This is, of course, a\n",
      "necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation. For as they have\n",
      "no pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this respect to the very\n",
      "lowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently wholly devoid of\n",
      "brain-power, and have neither reflection, judgment nor forethought, and\n",
      "hardly any memory. Hence, in their fits of fury, they remember no claims\n",
      "and recognise no distinctions. I have actually known a case where a Woman\n",
      "has exterminated her whole household, and half an hour afterwards, when\n",
      "her rage was over and the fragments swept away, has asked what has become\n",
      "of her husband and her children!\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a\n",
      "position where she can turn round. When you have them in their\n",
      "apartments -- which are constructed with a view to denying them that\n",
      "power -- you can say and do what you like; for they are then wholly\n",
      "impotent for mischief, and will not remember a few minutes hence the\n",
      "incident for which they may be at this moment threatening you with death,\n",
      "nor the promises which you may have found it necessary to make in order\n",
      "to pacify their fury.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole we get on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations, except\n",
      "in the lower strata of the Military Classes. There the want of tact and\n",
      "discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times indescribable\n",
      "disasters. Relying too much on the offensive weapons of their acute\n",
      "angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and seasonable\n",
      "simulations, these reckless creatures too often neglect the prescribed\n",
      "construction of the Women's apartments, or irritate their wives by\n",
      "ill-advised expressions out of doors, which they refuse immediately to\n",
      "retract. Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal truth indisposes\n",
      "them to make those lavish promises by which the more judicious Circle can\n",
      "in a moment pacify his consort. The result is massacre; not however\n",
      "without its advantages, as it eliminates the more brutal and troublesome\n",
      "of the Isosceles; and by many of our Circles the destructiveness of the\n",
      "Thinner Sex is regarded as one among many providential arrangements for\n",
      "suppressing redundant population, and nipping Revolution in the bud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately circular families I\n",
      "cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in\n",
      "Spaceland. There is peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may be\n",
      "called by that name, but there is necessarily little harmony of tastes or\n",
      "pursuits; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured safety at\n",
      "the cost of domestic comfort. In every Circular or Polygonal household it\n",
      "has been a habit from time immemorial -- and has now become a kind of\n",

      "daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths towards their\n",
      "husband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family of distinction\n",
      "to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a kind of portent,\n",
      "involving loss of _status_. But, as I shall soon shew, this custom,\n",
      "though it has the advantage of safety, is not without its disadvantages.\n",

      "In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman -- where the wife\n",

      "household avocations -- there are at least intervals of quiet, when the\n",
      "wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the\n",
      "continuous Peace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes there is too\n",
      "often no peace. There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye are\n",
      "ever directed towards the Master of the household; and light itself is\n",
      "not more persistent than the stream of feminine discourse. The tact and\n",
      "skill which suffice to avert a Woman's sting are unequal to the task of\n",
      "stopping a Woman's mouth; and as the wife has absolutely nothing to say,\n",
      "and absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or conscience to prevent her\n",
      "from saying it, not a few cynics have been found to aver that they prefer\n",

      "\n",
      "The answer is threefold. The first means of recognition is the sense of\n",
      "hearing; which with us is far more highly developed than with you, and\n",
      "which enables us not only to distinguish by the voice our personal\n",
      "friends, but even to discriminate between different classes, at least so\n",
      "far as concerns the three lowest orders, the Equilateral, the Square, and\n",
      "the Pentagon -- for of the Isosceles I take no account. But as we ascend in\n",
      "the social scale, the process of discriminating and being discriminated\n",
      "by hearing increases in difficulty, partly because voices are\n",
      "assimilated, partly because the faculty of voice-discrimination is a\n",
      "plebeian virtue not much developed among the Aristocracy. And wherever\n",
      "there is any danger of imposture we cannot trust to this method. Amongst\n",
      "our lowest orders, the vocal organs are developed to a degree more than\n",
      "correspondent with those of hearing, so that an Isosceles can easily\n",
      "feign the voice of a Polygon, and, with some training, that of a Circle\n",
      "himself. A second method is therefore more commonly resorted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Feeling_ is, among our Women and lower classes -- about our upper classes\n",
      "I shall speak presently -- the principal test of recognition, at all events\n",
      "between strangers, and when the question is, not as to the individual,\n",
      "but as to the class. What therefore \"introduction\" is among the higher\n",
      "classes in Spaceland, that the process of \"feeling\" is with us. \"Permit\n",

      "from towns, the customary formula for a Flatland introduction. But in the\n",
      "towns, and among men of business, the words \"be felt by\" are omitted and\n",
      "the sentence is abbreviated to, \"Let me ask you to feel Mr. So-and-so\";\n",
      "although it is assumed, of course, that the \"feeling\" is to be\n",
      "reciprocal. Among our still more modern and dashing young gentlemen -- who\n",
      "are extremely averse to superfluous effort and supremely indifferent to\n",
      "the purity of their native language -- the formula is still further\n",

      "the \"slang\" of polite or fast society in the upper classes sanctions such\n",

      "\n",
      "Let not my Reader however suppose that \"feeling\" is with us the tedious\n",
      "process that it would be with you, or that we find it necessary to feel\n",

      "class to which he belongs. Long practice and training, begun in the\n",

      "shrinkage or expansion in some too susceptible part of the frame.\n",
      "Therefore, concluded that illustrious Philosopher, neither good conduct\n",
      "nor bad conduct is a fit subject, in any sober estimation, for either\n",

      "of Configuration sometimes comes in awkwardly; and I must confess that\n",
      "occasionally when one of my own Hexagonal Grandsons pleads as an excuse\n",
      "for his disobedience that a sudden change of the temperature has been too\n",
      "much for his Perimeter, and that I ought to lay the blame not on him but\n",

      "The weak point in the system of the Circles -- if a humble Square may\n",

      "Now the Irregularity of a Male is a matter of measurement; but as all\n",

      "superiority of lustre, or because of the charms of a low voice -- which,\n",

      "few sides in a highly-developed Polygon is not easily noticed, and is\n",
      "sometimes compensated by a successful operation in the Neo-Therapeutic\n",
      "Gymnasium, as I have described above; and the Circles are too much\n",
      "disposed to acquiesce in infecundity as a Law of the superior\n",
      "development. Yet, if this evil be not arrested, the gradual diminution of\n",
      "the Circular class may soon become more rapid, and the time may be not\n",

      "One other word of warning suggests itself to me, though I cannot so\n",
      "easily mention a remedy; and this also refers to our relations with\n",
      "Women. About three hundred years ago, it was decreed by the Chief Circle\n",
      "that, since women are deficient in Reason but abundant in Emotion, they\n",
      "ought no longer to be treated as rational, nor receive any mental\n",
      "education. The consequence was that they were no longer taught to read,\n",
      "nor even to master Arithmetic enough to enable them to count the angles\n",
      "of their husband or children; and hence they sensibly declined during\n",
      "each generation in intellectual power. And this system of female\n",

      "\n",
      "For the consequence is that, as things now are, we Males have to lead a\n",
      "kind of bi-lingual, and I may almost say bi-mental existence. With the\n",
      "Women, we speak of \"love,\" \"duty,\" \"right,\" \"wrong,\" \"pity,\" \"hope,\" and\n",
      "other irrational and emotional conceptions, which have no existence, and\n",
      "the fiction of which has no object except to control feminine\n",
      "exuberances; but among ourselves, and in our books, we have an entirely\n",
      "different vocabulary and I may almost say, idiom. \"Love\" then becomes\n",
      "\"the anticipation of benefits;\" \"duty\" becomes \"necessity\" or \"fitness;\"\n",
      "and other words are correspondingly transmuted. Moreover, among Women, we\n",
      "use language implying the utmost deference for their Sex; and they fully\n",

      "But thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?\" Receiving\n",
      "this abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way startled or\n",
      "molested his Royal Highness; and describing myself as a stranger I\n",
      "besought the King to give me some account of his dominions. But I had the\n",
      "greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information on points that\n",
      "really interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain from constantly\n",
      "assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be known to me and\n",
      "that I was simulating ignorance in jest. However, by persevering\n",
      "questions I elicited the following facts:\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch -- as he called himself -- was\n",
      "persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in\n",
      "which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and\n",
      "indeed the whole of Space. Not being able either to move or to see, save\n",
      "in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it. Though\n",
      "he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had come to\n",
      "him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made no answer,\n",
      "\"seeing no man,\" as he expressed it, \"and hearing a voice as it were from\n",
      "my own intestines.\" Until the moment when I placed my mouth in his World,\n",
      "he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except confused sounds beating\n",
      "against what I called his side, but what he called his _inside_ or\n",
      "_stomach_; nor had he even now the least conception of the region from\n",
      "which I had come. Outside his World, or Line, all was a blank to him;\n",
      "nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space; say, rather, all was\n",
      "non-existent.\n",
      "\n",
      "His subjects -- of whom the small Lines were Men and the Points Women -- were\n",
      "all alike confined in motion and eye-sight to that single Straight Line,\n",
      "which was their World. It need scarcely be added that the whole of their\n",
      "horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one ever see anything but a\n",
      "Point. Man, woman, child, thing -- each was a Point to the eye of a\n",
      "Linelander. Only by the sound of the voice could sex or age be\n",
      "distinguished. Moreover, as each individual occupied the whole of the\n",
      "narrow path, so to speak, which constituted his Universe, and no one\n",
      "could move to the right or left to make way for passers by, it followed\n",
      "that no Linelander could ever pass another. Once neighbours, always\n",
      "neighbours. Neighbourhood with them was like marriage with us. Neighbours\n",
      "remained neighbours till death did them part.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a\n",
      "Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised to\n",
      "note the vivacity and cheerfulness of the King. Wondering whether it was\n",
      "possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic relations, to\n",
      "enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for some time to\n",
      "question his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but at last I\n",
      "plunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his family. \"My\n",
      "wives and children,\" he replied, \"are well and happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Staggered at this answer -- for in the immediate proximity of the Monarch\n",
      "(as I had noted in my dream before I entered Lineland) there were none\n",
      "but Men -- I ventured to reply, \"Pardon me, but I cannot imagine how your\n",
      "Royal Highness can at any time either see or approach their Majesties,\n",
      "when there are at least half a dozen intervening individuals, whom you\n",
      "can neither see through, nor pass by? Is it possible that in Lineland\n",
      "proximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of\n",
      "children?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can you ask so absurd a question?\" replied the Monarch. \"If it were\n",
      "indeed as you suggest, the Universe would soon be depopulated. No, no;\n",
      "neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the birth of\n",
      "children is too important a matter to have been allowed to depend upon\n",
      "such an accident as proximity. You cannot be ignorant of this. Yet since\n",
      "you are pleased to affect ignorance, I will instruct you as if you were\n",
      "the veriest baby in Lineland. Know, then, that marriages are consummated\n",
      "by means of the faculty of sound and the sense of hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices -- as well\n",
      "as two eyes -- a bass at one and a tenor at the other of his extremities. I\n",
      "should not mention this, but that I have been unable to distinguish your\n",
      "tenor in the course of our conversation.\" I replied that I had but one\n",
      "voice, and that I had not been aware that His Royal Highness had two.\n",
      "\"That confirms my impression,\" said the King, \"that you are not a Man,\n",
      "but a feminine Monstrosity with a bass voice and an utterly uneducated\n",
      "ear. But to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nature herself having ordained that every Man should wed two wives --  -- \"\n",
      "\"Why two?\" asked I. \"You carry your affected simplicity too far,\" he\n",
      "cried. \"How can there be a completely harmonious union without the\n",
      "combination of the Four in One, viz. the Bass and Tenor of the Man and\n",
      "the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?\" \"But supposing,\" said I,\n",
      "\"that a man should prefer one wife or three?\" \"It is impossible,\" he\n",
      "said; \"it is as inconceivable as that two and one should make five, or\n",
      "that the human eye should see a Straight Line.\" I would have interrupted\n",
      "him; but he proceeded as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Once in the middle of each week a Law of Nature compels us to move to\n",
      "and fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence, which\n",
      "continues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one. In the\n",
      "midst of this choral dance, at the fifty-first pulsation, the inhabitants\n",
      "of the Universe pause in full career, and each individual sends forth his\n",
      "richest, fullest, sweetest strain. It is in this decisive moment that all\n",
      "our marriages are made. So exquisite is the adaptation of Bass to Treble,\n",
      "of Tenor to Contralto, that oftentimes the Loved Ones, though twenty\n",
      "thousand leagues away, recognise at once the responsive note of their\n",
      "destined Lover; and, penetrating the paltry obstacles of distance, Love\n",
      "unites the three. The marriage in that instant consummated results in a\n",
      "threefold Male and Female offspring which takes its place in Lineland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! Always threefold?\" said I. \"Must one wife then always have twins?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bass-voiced Monstrosity! yes,\" replied the King. \"How else could the\n",
      "balance of the Sexes be maintained, if two girls were not born for every\n",
      "boy? Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature?\" He ceased, speechless\n",
      "for fury; and some time elapsed before I could induce him to resume his\n",
      "narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will not, of course, suppose that every bachelor among us finds his\n",
      "mates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus. On the\n",
      "contrary, the process is by most of us many times repeated. Few are the\n",
      "hearts whose happy lot it is at once to recognise in each other's voices\n",
      "the partner intended for them by Providence, and to fly into a reciprocal\n",
      "and perfectly harmonious embrace. With most of us the courtship is of\n",
      "long duration. The Wooer's voices may perhaps accord with one of the\n",
      "future wives, but not with both; or not, at first, with either; or the\n",
      "Soprano and Contralto may not quite harmonise. In such cases Nature has\n",
      "provided that every weekly Chorus shall bring the three Lovers into\n",
      "closer harmony. Each trial of voice, each fresh discovery of discord,\n",
      "almost imperceptibly induces the less perfect to modify his or her vocal\n",
      "utterance so as to approximate to the more perfect. And after many trials\n",
      "and many approximations, the result is at last achieved. There comes a\n",
      "day at last, when, while the wonted Marriage Chorus goes forth from\n",
      "universal Lineland, the three far-off Lovers suddenly find themselves in\n",
      "exact harmony, and, before they are aware, the wedded Triplet is rapt\n",
      "vocally into a duplicate embrace; and Nature rejoices over one more\n",
      "marriage and over three more births.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking that it was time to bring down the Monarch from his raptures to\n",
      "the level of common sense, I determined to endeavour to open up to him\n",
      "some glimpses of the truth, that is to say of the nature of things in\n",
      "Flatland. So I began thus: \"How does your Royal Highness distinguish the\n",
      "shapes and positions of his subjects? I for my part noticed by the sense\n",
      "of sight, before I entered your Kingdom, that some of your people are\n",
      "Lines and others Points, and that some of the Lines are larger --  -- \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You speak of an impossibility,\" interrupted the King; \"you must have\n",
      "seen a vision; for to detect the difference between a Line and a Point by\n",
      "the sense of sight is, as every one knows, in the nature of things,\n",
      "impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing, and by the\n",
      "same means my shape can be exactly ascertained. Behold me -- I am a Line,\n",
      "the longest in Lineland, over six inches of Space --  -- \" \"Of Length,\" I\n",
      "ventured to suggest. \"Fool,\" said he, \"Space is Length. Interrupt me\n",
      "again, and I have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I apologised; but he continued scornfully, \"Since you are impervious to\n",
      "argument, you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I\n",
      "reveal my shape to my Wives, who are at this moment six thousand miles\n",
      "seventy yards two feet eight inches away, the one to the North, the other\n",
      "to the South. Listen, I call to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He chirruped, and then complacently continued: \"My wives at this moment\n",
      "receiving the sound of one of my voices, closely followed by the other,\n",
      "and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in which\n",
      "sound can traverse 6.457 inches, infer that one of my mouths is 6.457\n",
      "inches further from them than the other, and accordingly know my shape to\n",
      "be 6.457 inches. But you will of course understand that my wives do not\n",
      "make this calculation every time they hear my two voices. They made it,\n",
      "once for all, before we were married. But they _could_ make it at any\n",
      "time. And in the same way I can estimate the shape of any of my Male\n",
      "subjects by the sense of sound.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how,\" said I, \"if a Man feigns a Woman's voice with one of his two\n",
      "voices, or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognised\n",
      "as the echo of the Northern? May not such deceptions cause great\n",
      "inconvenience? And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind by\n",
      "commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another?\" This of\n",
      "course was a very stupid question, for feeling could not have answered\n",
      "the purpose; but I asked with the view of irritating the Monarch, and I\n",
      "succeeded perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" cried he in horror, \"explain your meaning.\" \"Feel, touch, come\n",
      "into contact,\" I replied. \"If you mean by _feeling_,\" said the King,\n",
      "\"approaching so close as to leave no space between two individuals, know,\n",
      "Stranger, that this offence is punishable in my dominions by death. And\n",
      "the reason is obvious. The frail form of a Woman, being liable to be\n",
      "shattered by such an approximation, must be preserved by the State; but\n",
      "since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of sight from Man, the\n",
      "Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman shall be approached so\n",
      "closely as to destroy the interval between the approximator and the\n",
      "approximated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And indeed what possible purpose would be served by this illegal and\n",
      "unnatural excess of approximation which you call _touching_, when all the\n",
      "ends of so brutal and coarse a process are attained at once more easily\n",
      "and more exactly by the sense of hearing. As to your suggested danger of\n",
      "deception, it is non-existent: for the Voice, being the essence of one's\n",
      "Being, cannot be thus changed at will. But come, suppose that I had the\n",
      "power of passing through solid things, so that I could penetrate my\n",
      "subjects, one after another, even to the number of a billion, verifying\n",
      "the size and distance of each by the sense of _feeling_: how much time\n",
      "and energy would be wasted in this clumsy and inaccurate method! Whereas\n",
      "now, in one moment of audition, I take as it were the census and\n",
      "statistics, local, corporal, mental, and spiritual, of every living being\n",
      "in Lineland. Hark, only hark!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying he paused and listened, as if in an ecstasy, to a sound which\n",
      "seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable multitude\n",
      "of lilliputian grasshoppers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Truly,\" replied I, \"your sense of hearing serves you in good stead, and\n",
      "fills up many of your deficiencies. But permit me to point out that your\n",
      "life in Lineland must be deplorably dull. To see nothing but a Point! Not\n",
      "even to be able to Contemplate a Straight Line! Nay, not even to know\n",
      "what a Straight Line is! To see, yet to be cut off from those Linear\n",
      "prospects which are vouchsafed to us in Flatland! Better surely to have\n",
      "no sense of sight at all than to see so little! I grant you I have not\n",
      "your discriminative faculty of hearing; for the concert of all Lineland\n",
      "which gives you such intense pleasure, is to me no better than a\n",
      "multitudinous twittering or chirping. But at least I can discern, by\n",
      "sight, a Line from a Point. And let me prove it. Just before I came into\n",
      "your kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right, and then from right\n",
      "to left, with seven Men and a Woman in your immediate proximity on the\n",
      "left, and eight Men and two Women on your right. Is not this correct?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is correct,\" said the King, \"so far as the numbers and sexes are\n",
      "concerned, though I know not what you mean by 'right' and 'left.' But I\n",
      "deny that you saw these things. For how could you see the Line, that is\n",
      "to say the inside, of any Man? But you must have heard these things, and\n",
      "then dreamed that you saw them. And let me ask what you mean by those\n",
      "words 'left' and 'right.' I suppose it is your way of saying Northward\n",
      "and Southward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not so,\" replied I; \"besides your motion of Northward and Southward,\n",
      "there is another motion which I call from right to left.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "_King._ Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line\n",
      "altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "_King._ Out of my Line? Do you mean out of the World? Out of Space?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Well, yes. Out of _your_ World. Out of _your_ Space. For your Space\n",
      "is not the true Space. True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a\n",
      "Line.\n",
      "\n",
      "_King._ If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself\n",
      "moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ If you cannot tell your right side from my left, I fear that no\n",
      "words of mine can make my meaning clear to you. But surely you cannot be\n",
      "ignorant of so simple a distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "_King._ I do not in the least understand you.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Alas! How shall I make it clear? When you move straight on, does it\n",
      "not sometimes occur to you that you _could_ move in some other way,\n",
      "turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your\n",
      "side is now fronting? In other words, instead of always moving in the\n",
      "direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to move\n",
      "in the direction, so to speak, of your side?\n",
      "\n",
      "_King._ Never. And what do you mean? How can a man's inside \"front\" in\n",
      "any direction? Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,\n",
      "and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire\n",
      "to indicate to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland. As long as any part\n",
      "of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept exclaiming,\n",
      "\"I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.\" But when I had at last\n",
      "moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest voice, \"She is\n",
      "vanished; she is dead.\" \"I am not dead,\" replied I; \"I am simply out of\n",
      "Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line which you call Space,\n",
      "and in the true Space, where I can see things as they are. And at this\n",
      "moment I can see your Line, or side -- or inside as you are pleased to call\n",
      "it; and I can also see the Men and Women on the North and South of you,\n",
      "whom I will now enumerate, describing their order, their size, and the\n",
      "interval between each.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, \"Does this at\n",

      "up the same position as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Monarch replied, \"If you were a Man of sense -- though, as you\n",
      "appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but a\n",
      "Woman -- but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to reason.\n",
      "You ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that which my\n",
      "senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am daily\n",
      "conscious. I, in return, ask you to describe in words or indicate by\n",
      "motion that other Line of which you speak. Instead of moving, you merely\n",
      "exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning to sight; and instead\n",
      "of any lucid description of your new World, you simply tell me the\n",
      "numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts known to any child\n",
      "in my capital. Can anything be more irrational or audacious? Acknowledge\n",
      "your folly or depart from my dominions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed to\n",
      "be ignorant of my Sex, I retorted in no measured terms, \"Besotted Being!\n",
      "You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are in reality\n",
      "the most imperfect and imbecile. You profess to see, whereas you can see\n",
      "nothing but a Point! You plume yourself on inferring the existence of a\n",
      "Straight Line; but I _can see_ Straight Lines and infer the existence of\n",
      "Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and even Circles. Why\n",
      "waste more words? suffice it that I am the completion of your incomplete\n",
      "self. You are a Line, but I am a Line of Lines, called in my country a\n",

      "Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as\n",
      "if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same moment there arose\n",
      "from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing in\n",

      "of square inches in a Square whose side is 3 inches long.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The little Hexagon meditated on this awhile and then said to me: \"But you\n",
      "have been teaching me to raise numbers to the third power; I suppose 3^3\n",
      "must mean something in Geometry; what does it mean?\" \"Nothing at all,\"\n",
      "replied I, \"not at least in Geometry; for Geometry has only Two\n",
      "Dimensions.\" And then I began to show the boy how a Point by moving\n",
      "through a length of three inches makes a Line of three inches, which may\n",
      "be represented by 3; and how a Line of three inches, moving parallel to\n",
      "itself through a length of three inches, makes a Square of three inches\n",
      "every way, which may be represented by 3^2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this, my Grandson, again returning to his former suggestion, took me\n",
      "up rather suddenly and exclaimed, \"Well, then, if a Point by moving three\n",
      "inches, makes a Line of three inches represented by 3; and if a straight\n",
      "Line of three inches, moving parallel to itself, makes a Square of three\n",
      "inches every way, represented by 3^2; it must be that a Square of three\n",
      "inches every way, moving somehow parallel to itself (but I don't see how)\n",
      "must make a Something else (but I don't see what) of three inches every\n",
      "way -- and this must be represented by 3^3.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go to bed,\" said I, a little ruffled by his interruption; \"if you would\n",
      "talk less nonsense, you would remember more sense.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So my Grandson had disappeared in disgrace; and there I sat by my Wife's\n",
      "side, endeavouring to form a retrospect of the year 1999 and of the\n",
      "possibilities of the year 2000, but not quite able to shake off the\n",
      "thoughts suggested by the prattle of my bright little Hexagon. Only a few\n",
      "sands now remained in the half-hour glass. Rousing myself from my reverie\n",
      "I turned the glass Northward for the last time in the old Millennium; and\n",
      "in the act, I exclaimed aloud, \"The boy is a fool.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Straightway I became conscious of a Presence in the room, and a chilling\n",
      "breath thrilled through my very being. \"He is no such thing,\" cried my\n",
      "Wife, \"and you are breaking the Commandments in thus dishonouring your\n",
      "own Grandson.\" But I took no notice of her. Looking round in every\n",
      "direction I could see nothing; yet still I _felt_ a Presence, and\n",
      "shivered as the cold whisper came again. I started up. \"What is the\n",
      "matter?\" said my Wife, \"there is no draught; what are you looking for?\n",
      "There is nothing.\" There was nothing; and I resumed my seat, again\n",
      "exclaiming, \"The boy is a fool, I say; 3^3 can have no meaning in\n",
      "Geometry.\" At once there came a distinctly audible reply, \"The boy is not\n",
      "a fool; and 3^3 has an obvious Geometrical meaning.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "My Wife as well as myself heard the words, although she did not\n",
      "understand their meaning, and both of us sprang forward in the direction\n",
      "of the sound. What was our horror when we saw before us a Figure! At the\n",
      "first glance it appeared to be a Woman, seen sideways; but a moment's\n",
      "observation shewed me that the extremities passed into dimness too\n",
      "rapidly to represent one of the Female Sex; and I should have thought it\n",
      "a Circle, only that it seemed to change its size in a manner impossible\n",
      "for a Circle or for any Regular Figure of which I had had experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my Wife had not my experience, nor the coolness necessary to note\n",
      "these characteristics. With the usual hastiness and unreasoning jealousy\n",
      "of her Sex, she flew at once to the conclusion that a Woman had entered\n",
      "the house through some small aperture. \"How comes this person here?\" she\n",
      "exclaimed, \"you promised me, my dear, that there should be no ventilators\n",
      "in our new house.\" \"Nor are there any,\" said I; \"but what makes you think\n",
      "that the stranger is a Woman? I see by my power of Sight Recognition --  -- \"\n",
      "\"Oh, I have no patience with your Sight Recognition,\" replied she,\n",
      "\"'Feeling is believing' and 'A Straight Line to the touch is worth a\n",
      "Circle to the sight'\" -- two Proverbs, very common with the Frailer Sex in\n",
      "Flatland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said I, for I was afraid of irritating her, \"if it must be so,\n",
      "demand an introduction.\" Assuming her most gracious manner, my Wife\n",
      "advanced towards the Stranger, \"Permit me, Madam, to feel and be felt\n",
      "by --  -- \" then, suddenly recoiling, \"Oh! it is not a Woman, and there are\n",
      "no angles either, not a trace of one. Can it be that I have so misbehaved\n",
      "to a perfect Circle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am indeed, in a certain sense a Circle,\" replied the Voice, \"and a\n",
      "more perfect Circle than any in Flatland; but to speak more accurately, I\n",
      "am many Circles in one.\" Then he added more mildly, \"I have a message,\n",
      "dear Madam, to your husband, which I must not deliver in your presence;\n",
      "and, if you would suffer us to retire for a few minutes --  -- \" But my Wife\n",
      "would not listen to the proposal that our august Visitor should so\n",
      "incommode himself, and assuring the Circle that the hour for her own\n",
      "retirement had long passed, with many reiterated apologies for her recent\n",
      "indiscretion, she at last retreated to her apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I glanced at the half-hour glass. The last sands had fallen. The second\n",
      "Millennium had begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the sound of my Wife's retreating footsteps had died away, I\n",
      "began to approach the Stranger with the intention of taking a nearer view\n",
      "and of bidding him be seated: but his appearance struck me dumb and\n",
      "motionless with astonishment. Without the slightest symptoms of\n",
      "angularity he nevertheless varied every instant with gradations of size\n",
      "and brightness scarcely possible for any Figure within the scope of my\n",
      "experience. The thought flashed across me that I might have before me a\n",
      "burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous Irregular Isosceles, who, by\n",
      "feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow into the\n",
      "house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a sitting-room, the absence of Fog (and the season happened to be\n",
      "remarkably dry), made it difficult for me to trust to Sight Recognition,\n",
      "especially at the short distance at which I was standing. Desperate with\n",
      "fear, I rushed forward with an unceremonious \"You must permit me, Sir -- \"\n",
      "and felt him. My Wife was right. There was not the trace of an angle, not\n",
      "the slightest roughness or inequality: never in my life had I met with a\n",
      "more perfect Circle. He remained motionless while I walked round him,\n",
      "beginning from his eye and returning to it again. Circular he was\n",
      "throughout, a perfectly satisfactory Circle; there could not be a doubt\n",
      "of it. Then followed a dialogue, which I will endeavour to set down as\n",
      "near as I can recollect it, omitting only some of my profuse\n",
      "apologies -- for I was covered with shame and humiliation that I, a Square,\n",
      "should have been guilty of the impertinence of feeling a Circle. It was\n",
      "commenced by the Stranger with some impatience at the lengthiness of my\n",
      "introductory process.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ Have you felt me enough by this time? Are you not introduced\n",
      "to me yet?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Most illustrious Sir, excuse my awkwardness, which arises not from\n",
      "ignorance of the usages of polite society, but from a little surprise and\n",
      "nervousness, consequent on this somewhat unexpected visit. And I beseech\n",
      "you to reveal my indiscretion to no one, and especially not to my Wife.\n",
      "But before your Lordship enters into further communications, would he\n",
      "deign to satisfy the curiosity of one who would gladly know whence his\n",
      "Visitor came?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ From Space, from Space, Sir: whence else?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Pardon me, my Lord, but is not your Lordship already in Space, your\n",
      "Lordship and his humble servant, even at this moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ Pooh! what do you know of Space? Define Space.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Space, my Lord, is height and breadth indefinitely prolonged.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ Exactly: you see you do not even know what Space is. You\n",
      "think it is of Two Dimensions only; but I have come to announce to you a\n",
      "Third -- height, breadth, and length.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Your Lordship is pleased to be merry. We also speak of length and\n",
      "height, or breadth and thickness, thus denoting Two Dimensions by four\n",
      "names.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ But I mean not only three names, but Three Dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Would your Lordship indicate or explain to me in what direction is\n",
      "the Third Dimension, unknown to me?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ I came from it. It is up above and down below.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ My Lord means seemingly that it is Northward and Southward.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ I mean nothing of the kind. I mean a direction in which you\n",
      "cannot look, because you have no eye in your side.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Pardon me, my Lord, a moment's inspection will convince your\n",
      "Lordship that I have a perfect luminary at the juncture of two of my\n",
      "sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ Yes: but in order to see into Space you ought to have an eye,\n",
      "not on your Perimeter, but on your side, that is, on what you would\n",
      "probably call your inside; but we in Spaceland should call it your side.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ An eye in my inside! An eye in my stomach! Your Lordship jests.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ I am in no jesting humour. I tell you that I come from Space,\n",
      "or, since you will not understand what Space means, from the Land of\n",
      "Three Dimensions whence I but lately looked down upon your Plane which\n",
      "you call Space forsooth. From that position of advantage I discerned all\n",
      "that you speak of as _solid_ (by which you mean \"enclosed on four\n",
      "sides\"), your houses, your churches, your very chests and safes, yes even\n",
      "your insides and stomachs, all lying open and exposed to my view.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Such assertions are easily made, my Lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ But not easily proved, you mean. But I mean to prove mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I descended here, I saw your four Sons, the Pentagons, each in his\n",
      "apartment, and your two Grandsons the Hexagons; I saw your youngest\n",
      "Hexagon remain a while with you and then retire to his room, leaving you\n",
      "and your Wife alone. I saw your Isosceles servants, three in number, in\n",
      "the kitchen at supper, and the little Page in the scullery. Then I came\n",
      "here, and how do you think I came?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Through the roof, I suppose.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ Not so. Your roof, as you know very well, has been recently\n",
      "repaired, and has no aperture by which even a Woman could penetrate. I\n",
      "tell you I come from Space. Are you not convinced by what I have told you\n",
      "of your children and household.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Your Lordship must be aware that such facts touching the belongings\n",
      "of his humble servant might be easily ascertained by any one in the\n",
      "neighbourhood possessing your Lordship's ample means of obtaining\n",
      "information.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Stranger._ How shall I convince him? Surely a plain statement of facts\n",
      "followed by ocular demonstration ought to suffice. -- Now, Sir; listen to\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are living on a Plane. What you style Flatland is the vast level\n",
      "surface of what I may call a fluid, on, or in, the top of which you and\n",
      "your countrymen move about, without rising above it or falling below it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid. You call me a Circle; but in\n",
      "reality I am not a Circle, but an infinite number of Circles, of size\n",
      "varying from a Point to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one\n",
      "placed on the top of the other. When I cut through your plane as I am now\n",
      "doing, I make in your plane a section which you, very rightly, call a\n",
      "Circle. For even a Sphere -- which is my proper name in my own country -- if\n",
      "he manifest himself at all to an inhabitant of Flatland -- must needs\n",
      "manifest himself as a Circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not remember -- for I, who see all things, discerned last night the\n",
      "phantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain -- do you not\n",
      "remember, I say, how, when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were\n",
      "compelled to manifest yourself to the King not as a Square, but as a\n",
      "Line, because that Linear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent\n",
      "the whole of you, but only a slice or section of you? In precisely the\n",
      "same way, your country of Two Dimensions is not spacious enough to\n",
      "represent me, a being of Three, but can only exhibit a slice or section\n",
      "of me, which is what you call a Circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diminished brightness of your eye indicates incredulity. But now\n",
      "prepare to receive proof positive of the truth of my assertions. You\n",
      "cannot indeed see more than one of my sections, or Circles, at a time;\n",
      "for you have no power to raise your eye out of the plane of Flatland; but\n",
      "you can at least see that, as I rise in Space, so my section becomes\n",
      "smaller. See now, I will rise; and the effect upon your eye will be that\n",
      "my Circle will become smaller and smaller till it dwindles to a point and\n",
      "finally vanishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no \"rising\" that I could see; but he diminished and finally\n",
      "vanished. I winked once or twice to make sure that I was not dreaming.\n",
      "But it was no dream. For from the depths of nowhere came forth a hollow\n",
      "voice -- close to my heart it seemed -- \"Am I quite gone? Are you convinced\n",
      "now? Well, now I will gradually return to Flatland, and you shall see my\n",
      "section become larger and larger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every reader in Spaceland will easily understand that my mysterious Guest\n",
      "was speaking the language of truth and even of simplicity. But to me,\n",
      "proficient though I was in Flatland Mathematics, it was by no means a\n",
      "simple matter. The rough diagram given above will make it clear to any\n",
      "Spaceland child that the Sphere, ascending in the three positions\n",
      "indicated there, must needs have manifested himself to me, or to any\n",
      "Flatlander, as a Circle, at first of full size, then small, and at last\n",
      "very small indeed, approaching to a Point. But to me, although I saw the\n",
      "facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever. All that I could\n",
      "comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and vanished,\n",
      "and that he had now reappeared and was rapidly making himself larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had regained his original size, he heaved a deep sigh; for he\n",
      "perceived by my silence that I had altogether failed to comprehend him.\n",
      "And indeed I was now inclining to the belief that he must be no Circle at\n",
      "all, but some extremely clever juggler; or else that the old wives' tales\n",
      "were true, and that after all there were such people as Enchanters and\n",
      "Magicians.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long pause he muttered to himself, \"One resource alone remains,\n",
      "if I am not to resort to action. I must try the method of Analogy.\" Then\n",
      "followed a still longer silence, after which he continued our dialogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ Tell me, Mr. Mathematician; if a Point moves Northward, and\n",
      "leaves a luminous wake, what name would you give to the wake?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ A straight Line.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ And a straight Line has how many extremities?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ Now conceive the Northward straight line moving parallel to\n",
      "itself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind it the\n",
      "wake of a straight Line. What name will you give to the Figure thereby\n",
      "formed? We will suppose that it moves through a distance equal to the\n",
      "original straight Line. -- What name, I say?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ A Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ And how many sides has a Square? And how many Angles?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ Four sides and four angles.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ Now stretch your imagination a little, and conceive a Square in\n",
      "Flatland, moving parallel to itself upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ What? Northward?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ No, not Northward; upward; out of Flatland altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it moved Northward, the Southern points in the Square would have to\n",
      "move through the positions previously occupied by the Northern points.\n",
      "But that is not my meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean that every Point in you -- for you are a Square and will serve the\n",
      "purpose of my illustration -- every Point in you, that is to say in what\n",
      "you call your inside, is to pass upwards through Space in such a way that\n",
      "no Point shall pass through the position previously occupied by any other\n",
      "Point; but each Point shall describe a straight Line of its own. This is\n",
      "all in accordance with Analogy; surely it must be clear to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Restraining my impatience -- for I was now under a strong temptation to\n",
      "rush blindly at my Visitor and to precipitate him into Space, or out of\n",
      "Flatland, anywhere, so that I could get rid of him -- I replied: -- \n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what may be the nature of the Figure which I am to shape out by this\n",
      "motion which you are pleased to denote by the word 'upward'? I presume it\n",
      "is describable in the language of Flatland.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ Oh, certainly. It is all plain and simple, and in strict\n",
      "accordance with Analogy -- only, by the way, you must not speak of the\n",
      "result as being a Figure, but as a Solid. But I will describe it to you.\n",
      "Or rather not I, but Analogy. We began with a single Point, which of\n",
      "course -- being itself a Point -- has only _one_ terminal Point.\n",

      "One Line produces a Square with _four_ terminal Points.\n",

      "\n",
      "_I._ Eight.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"terminal Points?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ Of course; and all according to Analogy. But, by the way, not\n",
      "what _you_ call sides, but what _we_ call sides. You would call them\n",
      "_solids_.\n",

      "is always, if I may so say, one Dimension behind the thing. Consequently,\n",
      "as there is no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0 sides; a Line, if\n",
      "I may so say, has 2 sides (for the Points of a Line may be called by\n",

      "things that you consider closed. For example, I see in yonder cupboard\n",
      "near which you are standing, several of what you call boxes (but like\n",
      "everything else in Flatland, they have no tops nor bottoms) full of\n",
      "money; I see also two tablets of accounts. I am about to descend into\n",
      "that cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets. I saw you lock the\n",
      "cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key in your\n",
      "possession. But I descend from Space; the doors, you see, remain unmoved.\n",
      "Now I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet. Now I have it. Now I\n",
      "ascend with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rushed to the closet and dashed the door open. One of the tablets was\n",
      "gone. With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other corner of\n",
      "the room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the floor. I took\n",
      "it up. There could be no doubt -- it was the missing tablet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I groaned with horror, doubting whether I was not out of my senses; but\n",
      "the Stranger continued: \"Surely you must now see that my explanation, and\n",
      "no other, suits the phenomena. What you call Solid things are really\n",
      "superficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great Plane. I\n",
      "am in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of which you\n",
      "only see the outsides. You could leave this Plane yourself, if you could\n",
      "but summon up the necessary volition. A slight upward or downward motion\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The higher I mount, and the further I go from your Plane, the more I can\n",
      "see, though of course I see it on a smaller scale. For example, I am\n",
      "ascending; now I can see your neighbour the Hexagon and his family in\n",
      "their several apartments; now I see the inside of the Theatre, ten doors\n",
      "off, from which the audience is only just departing; and on the other\n",
      "side a Circle in his study, sitting at his books. Now I shall come back\n",
      "to you. And, as a crowning proof, what do you say to my giving you a\n",
      "touch, just the least touch, in your stomach? It will not seriously\n",
      "injure you, and the slight pain you may suffer cannot be compared with\n",
      "the mental benefit you will receive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain in my\n",
      "inside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me. A moment\n",
      "afterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but a dull ache\n",
      "behind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying, as he gradually\n",
      "increased in size, \"There, I have not hurt you much, have I? If you are\n",
      "not convinced now, I don't know what will convince you. What say you?\"\n",

      "My resolution was taken. It seemed intolerable that I should endure\n",

      "alarming the whole household by my cries for aid. I believe, at the\n",
      "moment of my onset, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane, and really\n",
      "found difficulty in rising. In any case he remained motionless, while I,\n",
      "hearing, as I thought, the sound of some help approaching, pressed\n",
      "against him with redoubled vigour, and continued to shout for assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere. \"This must not be,\" I\n",

      "louder tone, he hurriedly exclaimed, \"Listen: no stranger must witness\n",
      "what you have witnessed. Send your Wife back at once, before she enters\n",
      "the apartment. The Gospel of Three Dimensions must not be thus\n",
      "frustrated. Not thus must the fruits of one thousand years of waiting be\n",
      "thrown away. I hear her coming. Back! back! Away from me, or you must go\n",

      "sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line that\n",
      "was no Line; Space that was not Space; I was myself, and not myself. When\n",
      "I could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, \"Either this is madness or\n",
      "it is Hell.\" \"It is neither,\" calmly replied the voice of the Sphere, \"it\n",

      "perfect Circular beauty. What seemed the centre of the Stranger's form\n",
      "lay open to my view: yet I could see no heart, nor lungs, nor arteries,\n",
      "only a beautiful harmonious Something -- for which I had no words; but you,\n",
      "my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of the Sphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, \"How is it, O\n",

      "and yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries, thy liver?\"\n",
      "\"What you think you see, you see not,\" he replied; \"it is not given to\n",
      "you, nor to any other Being, to behold my internal parts. I am of a\n",
      "different order of Beings from those in Flatland. Were I a Circle, you\n",
      "could discern my intestines, but I am a Being composed, as I told you\n",
      "before, of many Circles, the Many in the One, called in this country a\n",

      "\n",
      "Bewildered though I was by my Teacher's enigmatic utterance, I no longer\n",
      "chafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration. He continued,\n",
      "with more mildness in his voice: \"Distress not yourself if you cannot at\n",
      "first understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland. By degrees they will\n",
      "dawn upon you. Let us begin by casting back a glance at the region whence\n",
      "you came. Return with me a while to the plains of Flatland, and I will\n",
      "show you that which you have so often reasoned and thought about, but\n",
      "never seen with the sense of sight -- a visible angle.\" \"Impossible!\" I\n",
      "cried; but, the Sphere leading the way, I followed as if in a dream, till\n",
      "once more his voice arrested me: \"Look yonder, and behold your own\n",
      "Pentagonal house and all its inmates.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that domestic\n",
      "individuality which I had hitherto merely inferred with the\n",
      "understanding. And how poor and shadowy was the inferred conjecture in\n",
      "comparison with the reality which I now beheld! My four Sons calmly\n",
      "asleep in the North-Western rooms, my two orphan Grandsons to the South;\n",
      "the Servants, the Butler, my Daughter, all in their several apartments.\n",
      "Only my affectionate Wife, alarmed by my continued absence, had quitted\n",
      "her room and was roving up and down in the Hall, anxiously awaiting my\n",
      "return. Also the Page, aroused by my cries, had left his room, and under\n",
      "pretext of ascertaining whether I had fallen somewhere in a faint, was\n",
      "prying into the cabinet in my study. All this I could now _see_, not\n",
      "merely infer; and as we came nearer and nearer, I could discern even the\n",
      "contents of my cabinet, and the two chests of gold, and the tablets of\n",
      "which the Sphere had made mention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Touched by my Wife's distress, I would have sprung downward to reassure\n",
      "her, but I found myself incapable of motion. \"Trouble not yourself about\n",

      "\n",
      "Once more I felt myself rising through space. It was even as the Sphere\n",
      "had said. The further we receded from the object we beheld, the larger\n",
      "became the field of vision. My native city, with the interior of every\n",
      "house and every creature therein, lay open to my view in miniature. We\n",
      "mounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the depths of mines and\n",
      "inmost caverns of the hills, were bared before me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth, thus unveiled\n",
      "before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, \"Behold, I am become as a\n",
      "God. For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or as\n",
      "they express it, _omnividence_, is the attribute of God alone.\" There was\n",
      "something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer: \"Is it\n",
      "so indeed? Then the very pickpockets and cut-throats of my country are to\n",
      "be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there is not one of\n",

      "\n",
      "_Sphere._ I do not know. But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our\n",
      "country can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no\n",
      "reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a\n",
      "God. This omnividence, as you call it -- it is not a common word in\n",
      "Spaceland -- does it make you more just, more merciful, less selfish, more\n",
      "loving? Not in the least. Then how does it make you more divine?\n",
      "\n",
      "_I._ \"More merciful, more loving!\" But these are the qualities of women!\n",

      "you know that building?\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure, in which I\n",
      "recognized the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland,\n",
      "surrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings at right angles to each\n",

      "\n",

      "first day of the year 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom I at once\n",
      "recognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square, and the Chief\n",
      "Clerk of the High Council. It was found recorded on each occasion that:\n",
      "\"Whereas the States had been troubled by divers ill-intentioned persons\n",
      "pretending to have received revelations from another World, and\n",
      "professing to produce demonstrations whereby they had instigated to\n",
      "frenzy both themselves and others, it had been for this cause unanimously\n",
      "resolved by the Grand Council that on the first day of each millenary,\n",
      "special injunctions be sent to the Prefects in the several districts of\n",
      "Flatland, to make strict search for such misguided persons, and without\n",
      "formality of mathematical examination, to destroy all such as were\n",
      "Isosceles of any degree, to scourge and imprison any regular Triangle, to\n",
      "cause any Square or Pentagon to be sent to the district Asylum, and to\n",
      "arrest any one of higher rank, sending him straightway to the Capital to\n",
      "be examined and judged by the Council.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You hear your fate,\" said the Sphere to me, while the Council was\n",
      "passing for the third time the formal resolution. \"Death or imprisonment\n",
      "awaits the Apostle of the Gospel of Three Dimensions.\" \"Not so,\" replied\n",
      "I, \"the matter is now so clear to me, the nature of real space so\n",

      "dexterity into the sea (if I may so call it) of Flatland, right in the\n",

      "horror, as the Sphere's circular section widened before them. But on a\n",
      "sign from the presiding Circle, -- who showed not the slightest alarm or\n",
      "surprise -- six Isosceles of a low type from six different quarters rushed\n",
      "upon the Sphere. \"We have him,\" they cried; \"No; yes; we have him still!\n",

      "his sincere regret that, in accordance with precedent and for the sake of\n",
      "secrecy, he must condemn him to perpetual imprisonment, but added his\n",
